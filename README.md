# Rainbow Fireballs

Processing sketch exploring the use of cycling colours, blurring and Perlin noise to create rainbow fireballs

The sketch makes use of Perlin noise and blurring classes developed in the [unicorn-flames-processing](https://github.com/AndrewCraigie/unicorn-flames-processing) repository.

The colour of pixels within the 'flames' are set by converting the alpha value of the pixel to hue values. This produces a 'rainbow' effect.
